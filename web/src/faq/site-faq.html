  <div class="answer">
    One of the best benefits of the site is that we take humans out of zombie
    chat rooms, and zombies out of human chat rooms. To do this, we ask that
    players submit their infections as soon as possible. However, this isn't
    always possible; not every player will go out into the game with a phone in
    hand, and we can't require them for various reasons. So, if a zombie
    infects a human but takes an hour to get back to their computer to submit
    the infection, that's an hour that the system thinks the victim is still
    human and shows notifications, chat messages, and other human-only things
    to the victim. So, we added this dialog that asks the human to self-report
    their infection, so that we can change their access accordingly.
